1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

  The Corner Grocer needs a program that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day. These records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes.
  They are interested in rearranging their produce section and need to know how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their customers.

2. What did you do particularly well?

     I personally feel as if I handled the creating and functions of the menu options well. It was the portion I felt most confident in prior to submitting.

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

   I feel as though I struggle with adding descriptions for what each segment does. It all makes sense when I read over it, so I often forget my descriptions to help others read it just as easily as I can.

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

   I did initially find it a struggle to tackle the menu options in regards to getting them all to function with one another. Luckily, there were videos for the course, as well as outside examples of
   this work I was able to watch to better understand.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
   
   The skills from this project I feel like will help in moving to future projects is nothing skill wise, but rather learning that I am not alone in my work, and that there are people online and through
   the connections I have personally that can help if I ever feel stuck in my work.
